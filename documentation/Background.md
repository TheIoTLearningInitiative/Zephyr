> Real Time Operating System
> > A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system (OS) intended to serve real-time application process data as it comes in, typically without buffering delays. Processing time requirements (including any OS delay) are measured in tenths of seconds or shorter. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_operating_system)

> __Single Address Space Operating System__
> > In computer science, a single address space operating system (or SASOS) is an operating system that provides for all processes only one globally shared virtual address space. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_address_space_operating_system)

> __Monolithic Kernel__
> > An operating system architecture where the entire operating system is working in kernel space and is alone in supervisor mode. The monolithic model differs from other operating system architectures (such as the microkernel architecture) in that it alone defines a high-level virtual interface over computer hardware. A set of primitives or system calls implement all operating system services such as process management, concurrency, and memory management. Device drivers can be added to the kernel as modules. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel)

> __Microkernel__
> > In computer science, a microkernel (also known as Î¼-kernel) is the near-minimum amount of software that can provide the mechanisms needed to implement an operating system (OS). These mechanisms include low-level address space management, thread management, and inter-process communication (IPC). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel)

> __Nanokernel__
> > A kernel where the total amount of kernel code, i.e. code executing in the privileged mode of the hardware, is very small. The term picokernel was sometimes used to further emphasize small size. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel#Nanokernel)

> __Semaphore__
> > In computer science, a semaphore is a variable or abstract data type that is used for controlling access, by multiple processes, to a common resource in a concurrent system such as a multiprogramming operating system. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)
