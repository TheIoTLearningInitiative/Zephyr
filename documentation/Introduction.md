__Getting Started__

> __Introduction to the Zephyr Project__
> > The Zephyr Kernel is a small-footprint kernel designed for use on resource-constrained systems: from simple embedded environmental sensors and LED wearables to sophisticated smart watches and IoT wireless gateways.

> __Getting Started Guide__ 
> > Use this guide to get started with your Zephyr development.

> __Zephyr Kernel Primer__ 
> > This section describes the major features of the Zephyr kernel and how to use them.

__Developer Guides__

> Build System User Guide
> > The Zephyr Kernelâ€™s build system is based on the Kbuild system used in the Linux kernel. This way the kernel embraces the recursive model used in Linux and the configuration model implemented using Kconfig.

> Application Development Primer
> > This section contains references that explain how to build microkernel and nanokernel applications.

> API Documentation
