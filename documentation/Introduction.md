# Introduction

> Zephyr is a small real-time operating system for connected, resource-constrained devices supporting multiple architectures and released under the Apache License 2.0. Originally developed as Rocket kernel by Wind River Systems for Internet of Things devices, Zephyr became a project of the Linux Foundation in February 2016. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyr_(operating_system)

> Zephyr Project is a small, scalable real-time operating system for use on resource-constrained systems supporting multiple architectures.  Developers are able to tailor their optimal solution. As a true open source project, the community can evolve the Zephyr Project to support new hardware, developer tools, sensor and device drivers.  Advancements in security, device management capabilities, connectivity stacks and file systems can be easily implemented. [Zephyr Homepage](https://www.zephyrproject.org/)

__Getting Started__

> __Introduction to the Zephyr Project__
> > The Zephyr Kernel is a small-footprint kernel designed for use on resource-constrained systems: from simple embedded environmental sensors and LED wearables to sophisticated smart watches and IoT wireless gateways.

> __Getting Started Guide__ 
> > Use this guide to get started with your Zephyr development. We have collected all procedures you will need in three basic steps: Setting Up for Zephyr Development, Developing Zephyr Applications and Building and Running an Application

> __Zephyr Kernel Primer__ 
> > This section describes the major features of the Zephyr kernel and how to use them.

__Developer Guides__

> __Build System User Guide__
> > The Zephyr Kernel’s build system is based on the Kbuild system used in the Linux kernel. This way the kernel embraces the recursive model used in Linux and the configuration model implemented using Kconfig.

> __Application Development Primer__
> > This section contains references that explain how to build microkernel and nanokernel applications.

> __API Documentation__
> > This section contains the API documentation automatically extracted from the code. To ease navigation, we have split the APis in nanokernel APIs and microkernel APIs.

> __Collaboration Guidelines__
> > Thank you for your interest in collaborating with the Zephyr Project. These guidelines provide the best ways to collaborate with the team: Contributing Code, Communication Tools and Documentation Style Guide

__Reference Guides__

> __Configuration Options Reference Guide__
> > Kconfig files describe the configuration symbols supported in the build system... The configuration options’ information is extracted directly from Kconfig ...

## Zephyr SDK

> Zephyr’s SDK contains all necessary tools and cross-compilers needed to build the kernel on all supported architectures. Additionally, it includes host tools such as a custom QEMU and a host compiler for building host tools if necessary.
